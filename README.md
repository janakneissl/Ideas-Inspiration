# Ideas-Inspiration
This repository contains ideas, I would like to follow through in the future. 

Currently I am a junior in the B.S. Molecular Medicine at University of Tuebingen, Germany. This program mostly focuses on biomedicla research, such as Immunology, Cancer biology, physiology, genetics, ... 
However, during my year abroad at UNC Chapel Hill I developed a passion for programming. Now, I am trying to integrate these two fields, interning in a Funcitonal Genomics Lab at SNU, South Korea. 

I am working with Sequencing data analysis, trying to learn the work with data files. 

In my free time, I like to spend as much time as possible outside, feeling nature and its power. I like to swim, play the flute and meditate.
